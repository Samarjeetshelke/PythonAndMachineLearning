### What is a Set?
A set is an unordered collection of unique items. Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable. The elements in a set are immutable (cannot be changed), but the set itself is mutable, meaning we can add or remove items from it.

### Creating a Set
You can create a set by placing all the items (elements) inside curly braces `{}`, separated by commas, or by using the built-in `set()` function.

```python
# Creating a set using curly braces
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(fruits)

# Creating a set using the set() function
vegetables = set(["carrot", "broccoli", "spinach"])
print(vegetables)
```

### Adding Elements to a Set
To add an element to a set, use the `add()` method.

```python
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
fruits.add("orange")
print(fruits)
```

### Removing Elements from a Set
You can remove elements from a set using the `remove()` or `discard()` methods. The `remove()` method will raise an error if the specified item does not exist, while the `discard()` method will not.

```python
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
fruits.remove("banana")  # Removes 'banana'
fruits.discard("orange")  # Does nothing since 'orange' is not in the set
print(fruits)
```

### Set Operations
Python provides a rich set of operations to work with sets. Here are some common operations:

- **Union**: Returns a set containing all items from both sets.
  ```python
  set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
  set2 = {"cherry", "dates", "figs"}
  union_set = set1.union(set2)
  print(union_set)
  ```

- **Intersection**: Returns a set containing only the items that are present in both sets.
  ```python
  set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
  set2 = {"cherry", "dates", "figs"}
  intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)
  print(intersection_set)
  ```

- **Difference**: Returns a set containing the items that are in the first set but not in the second set.
  ```python
  set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
  set2 = {"cherry", "dates", "figs"}
  difference_set = set1.difference(set2)
  print(difference_set)
  ```

- **Symmetric Difference**: Returns a set containing items that are in either set, but not in both.
  ```python
  set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
  set2 = {"cherry", "dates", "figs"}
  sym_diff_set = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)
  print(sym_diff_set)
  ```

### Checking Membership
You can check if an item is in a set or not using the `in` keyword.

```python
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print("apple" in fruits)  # True
print("orange" in fruits)  # False
```

### Iterating Through a Set
You can loop through the set items using a `for` loop.

```python
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

### Example Code
Here's an example that demonstrates the use of sets in Python:

```python
# Creating sets
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {"cherry", "dates", "figs"}

# Adding elements
set1.add("orange")

# Removing elements
set2.discard("figs")

# Set operations
union_set = set1.union(set2)
intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)
difference_set = set1.difference(set2)
sym_diff_set = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)

# Checking membership
is_apple_in_set1 = "apple" in set1

# Iterating through a set
for fruit in set1:
    print(fruit)

# Display results
print("Set1:", set1)
print("Set2:", set2)
print("Union:", union_set)
print("Intersection:", intersection_set)
print("Difference:", difference_set)
print("Symmetric Difference:", sym_diff_set)
print("Is 'apple' in Set1?", is_apple_in_set1)
```
