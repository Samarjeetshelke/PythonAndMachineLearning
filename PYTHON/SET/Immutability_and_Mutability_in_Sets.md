### Immutability and Mutability in Sets

- **Elements of a Set**: The individual elements within a set must be immutable. This means you can include items such as numbers, strings, and tuples (which are immutable data types), but you cannot include lists or dictionaries (which are mutable data types). This requirement ensures that the elements in a set remain unique and hashable.

- **Set Itself**: The set as a whole is mutable, which means you can add or remove elements from the set even though the individual elements themselves cannot be changed.

Here's a more detailed explanation:

### Immutable Elements
Elements in a set must be immutable so that the set can ensure the uniqueness and integrity of its elements. For instance, you can have integers, floats, strings, and tuples as elements in a set, but you cannot have lists or dictionaries as elements.

```python
# Valid set with immutable elements
valid_set = {1, 3.14, "apple", (1, 2)}

# Invalid set with mutable elements
# invalid_set = {[1, 2, 3], {"key": "value"}}  # This will raise a TypeError
```

### Mutable Set
A set itself is mutable, so you can add or remove elements using methods such as `add()`, `remove()`, `discard()`, etc.

```python
# Creating a set
my_set = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

# Adding an element
my_set.add("orange")
print(my_set)  # Output: {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange'}

# Removing an element
my_set.remove("banana")
print(my_set)  # Output: {'apple', 'cherry', 'orange'}

# Using discard() to remove an element (will not raise an error if the element is not found)
my_set.discard("kiwi")  # No error, even though "kiwi" is not in the set
print(my_set)  # Output: {'apple', 'cherry', 'orange'}
```

### Summary
- **Immutable elements**: Elements within a set must be of an immutable data type (e.g., numbers, strings, tuples).
- **Mutable set**: The set itself can be modified by adding or removing elements.

This combination of immutability and mutability ensures that sets can maintain unique, hashable elements while still allowing for flexible operations on the set as a whole.
