Lambda functions in Python are small anonymous functions defined using the `lambda` keyword. Unlike regular functions defined using `def`, lambda functions are typically used for short, simple operations that are not reused elsewhere in the code. They can take any number of arguments but have a single expression whose result is returned.

### Syntax of Lambda Functions
The syntax for a lambda function is:
```python
lambda arguments: expression
```
Here, `arguments` is a comma-separated list of inputs, and `expression` is a single expression whose value is returned when the lambda function is called.

### Examples of Lambda Functions

#### Basic Example
A simple lambda function to add two numbers:
```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(5, 3))  # Output: 8
```

#### Lambda Functions with No Arguments
A lambda function that takes no arguments and returns a constant value:
```python
constant = lambda: 42
print(constant())  # Output: 42
```

#### Lambda Functions in Higher-Order Functions
Lambda functions are often used with functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`, which take other functions as arguments.

##### Using `map()` with Lambda
The `map()` function applies a given function to all items in an input list:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squared = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))
print(squared)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

##### Using `filter()` with Lambda
The `filter()` function filters items out of a list based on a given function:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

##### Using `sorted()` with Lambda
The `sorted()` function sorts items based on a given key function:
```python
names = ["Charlie", "Alice", "Bob"]
sorted_names = sorted(names, key=lambda x: len(x))
print(sorted_names)  # Output: ['Bob', 'Alice', 'Charlie']
```

### Using Lambda Functions Inside Other Functions
Lambda functions can be defined inside other functions to provide inline operations:
```python
def make_incrementor(n):
    return lambda x: x + n

increment_by_5 = make_incrementor(5)
print(increment_by_5(10))  # Output: 15
```

### Limitations of Lambda Functions
1. **Single Expression**: Lambda functions are limited to a single expression. They cannot contain multiple statements or annotations.
2. **Readability**: While lambda functions can make code more concise, overusing them can lead to code that is hard to read and maintain. For complex operations, itâ€™s often better to define a regular function using `def`.

### Example of Using Lambda Functions
Here's an example that demonstrates the use of lambda functions with `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`:
```python
# List of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Using lambda with map to square the numbers
squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))
print("Squared Numbers:", squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

# Using lambda with filter to get even numbers
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print("Even Numbers:", even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Using lambda with sorted to sort by the last digit
sorted_by_last_digit = sorted(numbers, key=lambda x: x % 10)
print("Sorted by Last Digit:", sorted_by_last_digit)  # Output: [10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

Lambda functions are a powerful feature in Python, especially useful for short, throwaway functions. However, for more complex functionality, traditional functions defined using `def` are generally more appropriate.
