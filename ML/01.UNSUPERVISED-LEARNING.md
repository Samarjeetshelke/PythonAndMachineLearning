Unsupervised learning is different from the Supervised learning technique; as its name suggests, there is no need for supervision. It means, in unsupervised machine learning, the machine is trained using the unlabeled dataset, and the machine predicts the output without any supervision.

In unsupervised learning, the models are trained with the data that is neither classified nor labelled, and the model acts on that data without any supervision.

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on data that is not labeled. In contrast to supervised learning, where the model learns from input-output pairs, unsupervised learning algorithms try to find patterns, structures, or relationships in the data without any explicit guidance.
The main aim of the unsupervised learning algorithm is to group or categories the unsorted dataset according to the similarities, patterns, and differences. Machines are instructed to find the hidden patterns from the input dataset.

Let's take an example to understand it more preciously; suppose there is a basket of fruit images, and we input it into the machine learning model. The images are totally unknown to the model, and the task of the machine is to find the patterns and categories of the objects.

So, now the machine will discover its patterns and differences, such as colour difference, shape difference, and predict the output when it is tested with the test dataset.

### **Key Characteristics:**
1. **No Labeled Data:**
   - The data provided to the model does not come with labels or predefined outputs. The algorithm must infer the structure directly from the input data.

2. **Learning Objectives:**
   - The main objective is to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures within the data. This can involve grouping similar data points together, reducing data dimensions, or identifying outliers.

### **Common Types of Unsupervised Learning:**
Unsupervised Learning can be further classified into two types, which are given below:

- Clustering
- Association

1. **Clustering:**
   - **Purpose:** Group similar data points into clusters.
   - **Description:** Clustering algorithms partition the data into groups where data points in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.The clustering technique is used when we want to find the inherent groups from the data. It is a way to group the objects into a cluster such that the objects with the most similarities remain in one group and have fewer or no similarities with the objects of other groups. An example of the clustering algorithm is grouping the customers by their purchasing behaviour.
   - **Common Algorithms:**
     - **K-Means Clustering:** Divides data into \(k\) clusters based on feature similarity.
     - **Hierarchical Clustering:** Builds a tree of clusters using either a bottom-up or top-down approach.
     - **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):** Forms clusters based on the density of data points.

   - **Example:** Grouping customers into segments based on purchasing behavior.



2. **Association Rule Learning:**
   - **Purpose:** Discover relationships between variables in large datasets.
   - **Description:** Association rule learning algorithms identify frequent itemsets or patterns in data and generate rules that explain the relationships between them.Association rule learning is an unsupervised learning technique, which finds interesting relations among variables within a large dataset. The main aim of this learning algorithm is to find the dependency of one data item on another data item and map those variables accordingly so that it can generate maximum profit. This algorithm is mainly applied in Market Basket analysis, Web usage mining, continuous production, etc.
   - **Common Algorithms:**
     - **Apriori Algorithm:** Identifies frequent itemsets in transactional data and derives association rules.
     - **Eclat Algorithm:** Similar to Apriori but uses a depth-first search approach for finding frequent itemsets.

   - **Example:** Market basket analysis to find items frequently bought together (e.g., "If a customer buys bread, they are likely to buy butter").

**Advantages:**

These algorithms can be used for complicated tasks compared to the supervised ones because these algorithms work on the unlabeled dataset.
Unsupervised algorithms are preferable for various tasks as getting the unlabeled dataset is easier as compared to the labelled dataset.

**Disadvantages:**

The output of an unsupervised algorithm can be less accurate as the dataset is not labelled, and algorithms are not trained with the exact output in prior.
Working with Unsupervised learning is more difficult as it works with the unlabelled dataset that does not map with the output.

### **Applications of Unsupervised Learning:**
- **Customer Segmentation:** Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior or demographics.
- **Image Compression:** Reducing the dimensionality of images while retaining important features.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying unusual patterns in data, such as fraud detection or network security breaches.
- **Recommendation Systems:** Suggesting products or content based on user behavior patterns.
- **Genomics:** Finding patterns in genetic data to identify subtypes of diseases.

### **Challenges:**
- **Interpretability:** The results of unsupervised learning can be difficult to interpret, as there are no labels to guide the analysis.
- **Evaluation:** It can be challenging to assess the performance of an unsupervised learning model, as there is no clear ground truth.
- **Complexity:** Some unsupervised learning tasks can be computationally intensive, especially with large datasets.

### **Summary:**
Unsupervised learning is a powerful approach for discovering hidden patterns and structures in data without the need for labeled examples. It's widely used in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain, and it provides valuable insights that can guide decision-making in various fields.
