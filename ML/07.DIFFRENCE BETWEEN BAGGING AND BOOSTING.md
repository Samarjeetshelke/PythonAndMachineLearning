### **Difference Between Bagging and Boosting**

| **Aspect**            | **Bagging**                                           | **Boosting**                                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Objective**          | Reduce variance by creating independent models.       | Reduce bias by focusing on errors of previous models. |
| **Model Independence** | Models are trained independently.                     | Models are trained sequentially (dependent on previous models). |
| **Training Process**   | Parallel: Models can be trained simultaneously.       | Sequential: Models are trained one after another. |
| **Error Handling**     | Averages all models to reduce overfitting.            | Tries to correct the errors of previous models iteratively. |
| **Data Sampling**      | Uses bootstrapped datasets (random sampling with replacement). | Uses the entire dataset but assigns weights to focus on difficult samples. |
| **Focus**              | Reduces variance to improve overall stability.        | Reduces bias to improve accuracy.                 |
| **Overfitting**        | Less prone to overfitting, especially with strong learners. | More prone to overfitting if over-trained.        |
| **Common Algorithms**  | Random Forest, Bagging Classifier.                    | AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, CatBoost.   |
| **Aggregation**        | Combines predictions via averaging (regression) or voting (classification). | Combines predictions in a weighted manner.        |
| **Model Complexity**   | Simpler to implement and train.                       | More complex due to sequential dependency.        |
| **Performance**        | Effective for reducing variance in high-dimensional datasets. | Effective for improving weak learners' performance. |
