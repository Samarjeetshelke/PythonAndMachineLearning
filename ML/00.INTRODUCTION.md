AI (Artificial Intelligence), ML (Machine Learning), and Deep Learning are closely related concepts, but they differ in scope and complexity:

### 1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI):**
- **Scope:** AI is a broad field that encompasses any technique enabling machines to mimic human intelligence. This includes problem-solving, decision-making, language understanding, and perception.
- **Approach:** AI can be rule-based (using predefined rules and logic) or learning-based (using data-driven techniques like ML).
- **Examples:** Chatbots, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.

### 2. **Machine Learning (ML):**
- **Scope:** ML is a subset of AI focused on developing algorithms that allow machines to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.
- **Approach:** ML models are trained on large datasets to identify patterns and make predictions or decisions. Techniques include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
- **Examples:** Spam filters, image recognition, and predictive analytics.

### 3. **Deep Learning:**
- **Scope:** Deep Learning is a specialized subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to model complex patterns in large amounts of data.
- **Approach:** Deep Learning models, often called Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), can automatically extract features from raw data without manual feature engineering. They are particularly effective for tasks like image and speech recognition.
- **Examples:** Voice assistants, facial recognition systems, and natural language processing (NLP) applications.

### **Hierarchy and Relationships:**
- **AI** is the overarching field.
  - **ML** is a subset of AI, focusing on learning from data.
    - **Deep Learning** is a subset of ML, focusing on deep neural networks.

Each of these fields has its own techniques, applications, and levels of complexity, with AI being the broadest and Deep Learning being the most specialized.

# **Intorduction To Machine Learning:**

A subset of artificial intelligence known as machine learning focuses primarily on the creation of algorithms that enable a computer to independently learn from data and previous experiences. Arthur Samuel first used the term "machine learning" in 1959. It could be summarized as follows:

Without being explicitly programmed, machine learning enables a machine to automatically learn from data, improve performance from experiences, and predict things.

Machine learning algorithms create a mathematical model that, without being explicitly programmed, aids in making predictions or decisions with the assistance of sample historical data, or training data. For the purpose of developing predictive models, machine learning brings together statistics and computer science. Algorithms that learn from historical data are either constructed or utilized in machine learning. The performance will rise in proportion to the quantity of information we provide.

A machine can learn if it can gain more data to improve its performance.

# **How does Machine Learning work:**
A machine learning system builds prediction models, learns from previous data, and predicts the output of new data whenever it receives it. The amount of data helps to build a better model that accurately predicts the output, which in turn affects the accuracy of the predicted output.
Let's say we have a complex problem in which we need to make predictions. Instead of writing code, we just need to feed the data to generic algorithms, which build the logic based on the data and predict the output. Our perspective on the issue has changed as a result of machine learning. The Machine Learning algorithm's operation is depicted in the following block diagram:

# **Features of Machine Learning:**
- Machine learning uses data to detect various patterns in a given dataset.
- It can learn from past data and improve automatically.
- It is a data-driven technology.
- Machine learning is much similar to data mining as it also deals with the huge amount of the data.
