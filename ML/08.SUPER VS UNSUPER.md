### **Difference Between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning**

| **Aspect**               | **Supervised Learning**                                         | **Unsupervised Learning**                                  |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**            | Learns from labeled data to predict outcomes for new data.     | Learns from unlabeled data to identify hidden patterns.    |
| **Data Requirement**      | Requires labeled data with input-output pairs.                 | Works with unlabeled data, no predefined labels needed.    |
| **Goal**                  | Predict outputs or classify data based on historical patterns. | Discover structure, relationships, or clusters in data.   |
| **Output**                | Known outputs like classes or numerical values.                | Unknown outputs, such as clusters or latent features.      |
| **Dependency on Labels**  | Strongly depends on the availability of labels.                | Does not require labels to function.                      |
| **Training Process**      | Learns a mapping function between inputs and outputs.          | Groups data or reduces dimensionality without labels.      |
| **Evaluation**            | Easy to evaluate using metrics like accuracy or RMSE.          | Harder to evaluate; uses measures like silhouette score.   |
| **Examples of Algorithms**| Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks.            | K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA). |
| **Applications**          | Predicting stock prices, spam detection, image classification. | Customer segmentation, anomaly detection, gene clustering.|
| **Complexity**            | Easier to implement due to clear labels and targets.           | Harder to implement because patterns are inferred.         |
| **Flexibility**           | Limited to problems with labeled data.                         | Can be used on any unlabeled dataset.                     |
| **Example**               | - Predict house prices with size (input) and price (output).   | - Group customers by purchase behavior without labels.     |
