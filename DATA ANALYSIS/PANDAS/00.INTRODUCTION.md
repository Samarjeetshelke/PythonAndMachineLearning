### What is Pandas?

Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. It provides functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. The name "Pandas" is derived from both "Panel Data" and "Python Data Analysis." Wes McKinney created Pandas in 2008.

### Why Use Pandas?

- **Data Analysis**: Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.
- **Data Cleaning**: Pandas can clean messy data sets, making them readable and relevant.
- **Data Exploration**: It offers tools to explore data easily, understanding its structure and patterns.
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas provides powerful tools to manipulate data, such as merging, reshaping, selecting, and data aggregation.

### Difference Between NumPy and Pandas

#### NumPy
- **Primary Focus**: Numerical computations on multi-dimensional arrays.
- **Data Structure**: Homogeneous arrays (all elements are of the same type).
- **Operations**: Efficient mathematical and logical operations on arrays.
- **Usage**: Ideal for mathematical and statistical operations.

#### Pandas
- **Primary Focus**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Data Structures**: Series (one-dimensional) and DataFrame (two-dimensional), capable of holding heterogeneous data types.
- **Operations**: Reading/writing data, handling missing data, merging, grouping, reshaping.
- **Usage**: Ideal for handling and analyzing structured data.

### Example

#### Using NumPy

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a NumPy array
data = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Performing operations
mean = np.mean(data, axis=0)
print("Mean of each column:", mean)
```

#### Using Pandas

```python
import pandas as pd

# Creating a DataFrame
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': [1, 4, 7],
    'B': [2, 5, 8],
    'C': [3, 6, 9]
})
```

### Pandas Two Main Data Structures

Pandas primarily uses two key data structures for data manipulation and analysis: **Series** and **DataFrame**.

#### 1. Series

- **Description**: A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type (integer, string, float, etc.). It is similar to a column in a table or a single column of data.
- **Indexing**: Each element in a Series has a unique label (index).

**Example of Series**:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Creating a Series
data = pd.Series([10, 20, 30, 40], index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])
print(data)
```

**Output**:
```
a    10
b    20
c    30
d    40
dtype: int64
```

#### 2. DataFrame

- **Description**: A DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. It can be thought of as a table or a collection of Series.
- **Indexing**: Each row and column in a DataFrame has a unique label (index for rows and column names for columns).

**Example of DataFrame**:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Creating a DataFrame
data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 35],
    'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago']
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

**Output**:
```
      Name  Age         City
0    Alice   25     New York
1      Bob   30  Los Angeles
2  Charlie   35      Chicago
```

### Summary

- **Series**: One-dimensional, indexed array, similar to a single column of data.
- **DataFrame**: Two-dimensional, indexed table, similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table with rows and columns.

These data structures provide powerful tools for data manipulation and analysis, allowing users to perform a wide range of operations efficiently.

# Performing operations
mean = data.mean()
print("Mean of each column:\n", mean)
```
