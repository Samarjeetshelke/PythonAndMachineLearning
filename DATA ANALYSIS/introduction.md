## Introduction

Data analysis is a critical skill in today's data-driven world. Python, with its powerful libraries, makes it easier to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data. This folder provides an introduction to NumPy and Pandas, which are essential tools for any data analyst or scientist.

## NumPy

### Overview

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a library used for scientific computing. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and a large collection of mathematical functions to operate on these data structures.

### Installation

To install NumPy, you can use pip:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

### Basic Operations

Here are some basic operations you can perform with NumPy:

- Creating arrays
- Array indexing and slicing
- Mathematical operations
- Aggregation functions (e.g., sum, mean)

### Resources

- [NumPy Official Documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)
- [NumPy Tutorial by W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy_intro.asp)

## Pandas

### Overview

Pandas is a library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools. It is built on top of NumPy and provides two main data structures: Series (one-dimensional) and DataFrame (two-dimensional).

### Installation

To install Pandas, you can use pip:
```bash
pip install pandas
```

### Basic Operations

Here are some basic operations you can perform with Pandas:

- Creating Series and DataFrames
- Data indexing and selection
- Data manipulation (e.g., filtering, grouping, merging)
- Data visualization

### Resources

- [Pandas Official Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)
- [Pandas Tutorial by W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas_intro.asp)
